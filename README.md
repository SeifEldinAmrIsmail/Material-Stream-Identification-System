# Waste Classification ML Project

This project classifies waste images into material types using classical ML
(SVM and k-NN) on handcrafted image features, and deploys the best model in
a real-time webcam application.

## Project structure

- `data/` – raw and processed datasets
- `src/` – source code (data, features, models, app)
- `models/` – saved trained models
- `notebooks/` – exploration & experiments
- `scripts/` – command-line entry points (prepare data, train, evaluate, run app)
- `reports/` – final report and figures
